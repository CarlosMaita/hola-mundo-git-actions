The `/my-laravel-app/my-laravel-app/resources/lang` directory is typically used to store language files for localization in a Laravel application. Since you haven't specified a particular language file or content, I will create a default language file for English.

Here are the contents for the file `/my-laravel-app/my-laravel-app/resources/lang/en/messages.php`:

return [
    'welcome' => 'Welcome to our application!',
    'goodbye' => 'Thank you for visiting!',
    'error' => 'An error occurred. Please try again later.',
];
